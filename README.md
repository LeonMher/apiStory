# apiStory
This is a unique project that I made while learning Node Js
There are tons of stories in various forms (books, movies ect) but this particular one is called an API story. 
What the heck is an API story you might ask??? Let me explain :) 
In this world of real time data that is being updated every SECOND I wrote a story that is telling a few stories that are being updated every second! Yes! API's are changing and this the story
and the meaning of the story! So, reading the SAME story you're actually reading a NEW story with a NEW meaning. Hope that makes sense and enjoy it ;)
